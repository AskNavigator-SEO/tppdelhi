                Discounting or bargaining is something we all do, and we want to save more money. The bargaining with packers and movers is fair, but to save money. But you can save more money even before the service is booked. Below are the 5 steps that can save your money up to 40% while Shifting in delhi.
              </p>
              <h3>Planning and moving strategy</h3>
              <p>Moving to a new place can be expensive if you don't plan correctly. Planning makes it easy to understand your household goods. You can select the required goods and disown the unnecessary ones. Even shifting time and date is crucial for saving money.</p>

              <h3>List Your Goods</h3>
              <p>You should make a list of total household goods. The list can give the actual image of necessary goods that will be shifted. You must know the quantity you have. Sort out the goods according to value and necessity. The list will help you remember your goods after moving and unloading.</p>

              <h3>Carry valuable and essential goods</h3>
              <p>When you sort out the essential goods, keep some of them to yourself. These valuable and essential goods can be anything such as laptops, Jewellery, documents, etc. It would be best if you carried away anything related to Data, Metals, and small electronics.</p>

              <h3>Sell or Donate unnecessary goods</h3>
              <p>After making a list and identifying valuable goods, it's time to select the required goods. Any big electronics, kitchen, and furniture goods are essential commodities because they are expensive and required. Donate the clothes if not needed, Clean the refrigerator and consume every food. Don't keep the food items while moving. Sell if you don't need some furniture and electronic goods.</p>

              <h3>Choose the best shifting day and shared trucks</h3>
              <p>You have planned your shifting date. Don't book your service during month end or public holidays. The charges can shoot up by 20%. Weekdays or mid-months are the best days to do the shifting. Also, don't try to book a individual transport. You can go by sharing trucks with 2 other houses. Transportation accounts for more than 50% of moving service charges.</p>

            <h2>Factors That affect your Shifting Cost</h2>
            <span class="underline"></span>
            <p>
              We have talked about saving your money while shifting household goods. Now, let's look at different factors that can increase your shifting cost. 
            </p>

            <h3>Quantity and Weight of Luggage</h3>
            <p>
              If you live in a 3BHK apartment, you might have a lot of household goods. The more quantity of goods you will have, the more space it will require and the bigger truck will be needed. Even the overall weight of luggage can increase the cost because it will exhaust more fuel. The increase in transportation size can increase the shifting cost because transportation accounts for more than 50% of the total shifting cost.
            </p>

            <h3>Distance between Current Location & Destination</h3>
            <p>
              Your destination or house location is a significant factor for high shifting costs. Different places will have various cost factors. Let'sLet's understand it by an example. If you are moving 3BHK goods from Delhi to Lucknow, the cost will be around Rs 9000. but the same 3BHk moving from Delhi to Manali cost Rs.7500.
              <br>
              Even though the distance is the same, the demand for moving to Lucknow is less than in Manali. It is called an Outward destination. It will reduce the cost if you are moving to a favourable destination.
            </p>

            <h3>Shared or Separate Vehicle</h3>
            <p>
              The shared and separate vehicles have their own advantages. In terms of pricing, a Shared vehicle saves around 25% of shifting cost as compared to an individual vehicle. A separate vehicle is only advisable if you are living in a bigger house or 3BHK apartment. For 1BHK or 2BHK owners, you should get a shared vehicle with 2 other household goods to save your cost. A shared vehicle can only cost you more if the vendor doesn't properly arrange your goods in trucks, which might get stolen or cracked.
            </p>

            <h3>Additional Services</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from Packing material, transportation, and labour charges, Some additional services can increase your cost. For long-distance shifting, Insurance is advisable for everyone to save on future losses. But insurance costs around 3% of total household goods. You will need assembly/disassembly service for AC that can cost around Rs.300-500. If you want the staff to take the household goods inside the house, they will ask for additional money or tip. In case you don't have a working elevator, the need for a rope or pulley may burn your wallet.
            </p>

            <h3>Labour Charges in Your Area</h3>
            <p>
              The manpower is executing all the house shifting work such as packing, loading, transportation, unloading, and unpacking. Without them, work is impossible. Their high pricing can affect your shifting costs. Labour charges in Tier-1 cities are higher than in Tier-2&3 cities. These charges are increased or decreased according to the demand and years of experience. An experienced delhi labour asks for 1.5 times more money than Gurugram labour. The labour will ask for more money if you live in a posh area (even in a rental house).
            </p>
