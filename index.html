            <h2>Factors which affect your Shifting Cost</h2>
            <span class="underline"></span>
            <p>
              Packers and Movers in Delhi charge reasonable costs from their
              customers. The charges of Packers Movers in Delhi depend on
              various factors. These factors are responsible for increasing or
              decreasing the demands of their services. Some of the elements are
              as follows-
            </p>

            <h3>Charge affected by volume of goods</h3>
            <p>
              The first and foremost factor responsible for affecting the
              charges of Packers and Movers Delhi is the volume of goods.
              Other factors influence this factor. The number of trucks and
              labor required depends on the volume of goods. Hence, with the
              increase in goods volume, their charges increase and get reduced
              with the volume deduction.
            </p>

            <h3>Packing charges by movers and packers</h3>
            <p>
              If the company uses high-quality packing materials like cardboard,
              papers, tapes, and other essential material, their charges
              automatically increase. On the other hand, using low-quality
              packing material needs less money, and hence the costs get
              reduced.
            </p>

            <h3>Distance also can affect the moving charges</h3>
            <p>
              If you have to shift your belonging to a higher stretch, the
              higher charges you have to pay for that. Turning in local areas
              requires less time and fuel; therefore, you must pay less for
              that.
            </p>

            <h3>Labour cost in Delhi</h3>
            <p>
              It's evident that for shifting 1BHK or 2BHK apartments, less labor
              is necessary because of the low volume of goods. Still, for
              turning a 3-4BHK apartment, more work is required, increasing the
              charges of Movers and Packers in Delhi.
            </p>

            <h3>What additional service is provided by packers in delhi</h3>
            <p>
              If the client requires other facilities like unpacking and
              reassembling their goods, the company charges more from them.
            </p>

            <h3>A vehicle cost during a shifting</h3>
            <p>
              The types of vehicle required for moving goods and services
              directly affects the cost. For large volumes of goods, large
              trucks require that increases the charges instantly. On the other
              hand, the type of vehicle you choose for moving goods also affects
              your pocket.
            </p>

            <p>
              Though shifting through a professional company requires charges
              but doing shifting your own will increase your cost. The traffic
              and long-distance will increase your cost of moving. In the whole
              transmit process your new items may also get damage that
              automatically increases your cost of moving.
            </p>

            <h3>Can be damage your goods</h3>
            <p>
              In Delhi where distances are long requires lots of time to move
              from one place to another. Without knowledge and experience moving
              furniture, electronic appliances, delicate items is risky and you
              may face damages for these goods.
            </p>

            <h3>You can face personal injuries</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from the risk to your goods and property shifting the risk
              of self-injuries is also high when you decide to move your
              household material on your own. The chances of accidents and
              injuries are high.
            </p>

            <h3>Property can be damaged in self-shifting</h3>
            <p>
              During the transmit of goods the risk of property damage is always
              present. The furniture, tiles, scratches on the wall may take
              place when you move your belongings without having sufficient
              knowledge.
