            <!-- <========================= charges of packers and movers ===============================> -->
            <h2>Factors which affect your Shifting Cost</h2>
            <span class="underline"></span>
            <p>
                Estimating packers and movers charges can be difficult. The charges are always based on several aspects. These factors are all analysed by them with care and, then, they calculate the reasonable price they'll be charging the cost of their work. Professional packers and movers will never hide or evade fees to their customers. They employ a fixed calculation technique and base their cost. If they adopt their principle of honesty, clients and inform them of the charges, they charge.
                <br>
                The main factors upon which their charges are based are:
            </p>

            <h3>Long distance factor</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main factors is distance, which is the most important factor that determines the cost is distance. The more distance you will need to cover, the more you will have to pay. The fuel consumption and the cost of driving will all rise depending on the number of miles you'd like to cover. Due to the increase in kilometres, the driver will take longer, and fuel usage will increase. Therefore, it will directly impact the price of moving.
            </p>

            <h3>The quantity of the goods or the quantity of items</h3>
            <p>
                The quantity of the goods or the quantity of items you wish to move affects other aspects like the dimensions that the vehicle is, the number of workers required, the number of packing materials required and so on. This directly raises the price of their consumption rises. It is therefore beneficial to have the extra materials that are not required to make the number of items.
            </p>

            <h3>Quantity and quality of packaging material</h3>
            <p>
                For the gifting process, especially during wintertime, it's best to choose high-quality and waterproof packing materials even though it can increase the costs of packing and will directly impact and thus your costs for moving. In contrast, the use of inferior packing material will cost you less. However, the chance of damage is extremely high. The amount of merchandise used affects the packaging material required. With the increasing quantity of goods that are packed, the packing material needed is greater and, consequently, will raise the price.
            </p>

            <h3>Which types of vehicles is used</h3>
            <p>
                The types of vehicles used to transport items from one location to another are necessary. The kind of vehicle you pick for moving will affect the prices of the packers and movers. If the truck's size is large, it will cost more. There are two kinds of trucks that can be used to transport your goods.
            </p>

            <h3>Shared truck service</h3>
            <p>
                If you choose to use the services of a shared vehicle, the household items are shared by 2-3 people. This means that you'll have to pay less to transport your belongings to your new location.
            </p>

            <h3>Specialised truck service</h3>
            <p>
                On the other hand when you choose to use an exclusive truck and it is used to move your items only, and thus the cost of transportation that you are required to pay. In this case, you will have to shell out more money and the cost of shifting is also more expensive.
            </p>

            <h3>labour Quantity</h3>
            <p>
                The amount of people needed to help you move is contingent on the number of items you carry in your possession. To move fewer items, you will require a few workers who will help you in moving the items. If you're moving a larger amount of items, it becomes difficult for just one person to move the goods, and thus you will require more labour. As the number of labour expenses per worker increases, the total cost of moving is affected.
            </p>

            <h3>Work physical exertion</h3>
            <p>
                The amount of effort required to work physical exertion also can impact the cost of transportation. If the building is equipped with an elevator or lift facility, the physical effort required by workers is reduced and the costs could be lower. In the event of a lack of elevator facilities, workers are required to utilize a rope to move large and heavy objects. This can increase the work of labour, and the cost will go up.
            </p>
