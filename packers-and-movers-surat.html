            <h3>The volume of goods</h3>
            <p>
                The volume of goods directly influences the charges of moving. You just check the volume of your goods before moving. Keep aside all the unnecessary things that are of no use because they may increase your moving cost. If the volume is more, you have to pay money to the moving company as the requirement of manpower and packing material increases. On other the hand, if the volume of goods is less, it will save your money, and you need to pay less for that.
            </p>

            <h3>Distance will affect you budget</h3>
            <p>
                The distance between the origin and destination plays a significant role in determining the charges of moving. With the increase in distance, the consumption of fuel and the charges of a driver increases that directly increasing the cost of moving. For shorter distances, less time and less fuel are required that decrease the cost of moving.
            </p>

            <h3>Additional services by TPMD</h3>
            <p>

Some additional services such as insurance facilities, unpacking of goods, warehouse facilities, and many more. Mainly all these services are not estimated by packers and movers companies in their charging policy. If you hire all these services, we add the cost of additional services, and hence your charges will increase.
            </p>

            <h3>Packing material quality</h3>
            <p>
                The cost of packing materials directly influences the cost of your moving. Some people prefer to pack their belongings with waterproof material or materials of high quality the charges of packing increases. The packers and movers include all packing charges in estimated value which directly increases the cost of packing and moving services.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of vehicles and goods</h3>
            <p>If you want to shift your belongings which are large and are heavy in weight you have to hire Big trucks of moving them. As it will also take a large space to carry the big size of items. The requirement of trucks in such situations increases, and hence the cost of moving also increases.</p>

            <h3>The number of manpower required</h3>
            <p>If you want to move 3-4BHK apartments, your belongings will be more which will require more manpower for shifting the goods. In such a situation, the charges of labour cost increase that will directly affect your overall cost of moving. In the same way, if you want to relocate your 1-2BHK apartments the volume of goods will be less and hence the required number of manpower will be less which reduces the charges of packing and moving company.</p>
