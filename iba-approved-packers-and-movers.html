            <h3>The volume of goods</h3>
            <p>
                The professional charges depends on the volume of goods. For small houses shifting the requirement of manpower, trucks, packing material requires less and hence the consumer has to bear fewer charges. On the other hand for a large volume of goods the requirement of everythingâ€™s increases that automatically raises their charges.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirement of trucks</h3>
            <p>
                The larger the volume of goods the more space it will take in your vehicle. Heavy items and a large number of goods required large space in the truck. The requirement of a truck increases because of that hence the charges automatically increase. If the requirement of trucks reduces the need for trucks also gets reduced and so, customers have to bear fewer charges for shifting of goods.
            </p>

            <h3>Distance</h3>

The more the distance the consumption of fuel and driver payment increase and it directly affects the overall cost of the shifting. For a local move, the consumption of fuel decreases, and the charges they have to pay will be less.
