                  <h2>What are the risks you face while self-shifting in Delhi?</h2>
                <p>Some people tend to save even more money. They decide to shift their household goods by themselves. <br> At the same time, self-shifting is not bad but may come with many risks. Self-shifting in Delhi can be a <br> scary experience for you. Let'sLet's look at possible dangers without being ignorant. </p>

              <h3 id="home-shift">Self-shifting can take more time to shift</h3>
              <p>
                House shifting is professional work. The more efficient packers and movers are very punctual and time-efficient ones. The delay in self-shifting can cost you more than the packer and movers shifting. If you are working individually, searching for quality packing material, transportation, and labour at affordable rates will be hard. Also, you have to indulge in the process to ensure safety and timely work. This can cost you salary cuts at your job.
              </p>

              <h3 id="office-shift">Can increase your budget</h3>
              <p>While doing all the work yourself, you will not find affordable transportation. Most transporters will not decrease their pricing because you are a one-time borrower. You are more likely to get charged more for transportation. They even tend to commit fraud by not sending good vehicles during self-shifting. Labour will use this opportunity to capture more rates. Overall, self-shifting will cost around 2.2 times more than packers and movers.</p>


              <h3 id="vehicle-shift">Can damage your household goods</h3>
              <p>Proper packing of your goods is a tedious process. You should arrange it accordingly so that it doesn't break or scratch. Inexperience in packing can lead to more damage to your household goods than saving money from packers and movers. Also, placing goods is important while delivering your goods to the desired destination.</p>

              <h3 id="transporting">You can face personal injuries</h3>
              <p>After examining all the factors affecting your shifting cost, personal injuries are the most significant factor. It will directly affect your body. Your hand might get cut by a paper cutter. You wouldn't be able to lift your household goods. The truck journey might become a nightmare for you. Many things are at stake while doing self-shifting.</p>

              <h3>Shifting Process of Packers and Movers in Delhi-NCR</h3>
              <p>You should know "How packers and makers actually do moving procedures." We have curated a detailed process to help you understand the basic moving structure.</p>

              <h4>Pre-Moving survey of your luggage</h4>

              <h4>Rough Price Quotation</h4>
              <p>After a thorough survey, we will tell you about the rough price quotation. The raw price quotation will give the price estimation. The price quotations have different charges based on the quantity of goods, their estimated weight, vehicle required for household goods, use of Quality packing materials, the requirement of manpower, and Insurance (if needed).</p>

              <h4>Packing your Luggage Carefully</h4>
              <p>If you agree with the quotation, we can now pack the household goods. Now, different things need different types of packing material. For LED, Washing machines, or any electronic item, we will use a rectangle carton box with thermocol in it. For sofa and furniture, carton boxes with inner cushions will protect them from damage, shock, or scratch.</p>

              <h4>Loading of your household goods</h4>
              <p>After proper and neat packing of household goods, we will load the household goods on the truck. Now arrangement of goods is necessary to ensure safety till the destination. The large and heavy goods will be placed in the middle to restrict heavy movement, and the sensitive things will be kept above the heavy goods. All these things will be arranged to avoid significant damage in case of heavy truck movements.</p>

              <h4>Delivering your household goods to your destination</h4>
              <p>If you have packed the household goods and loaded them on the truck, we are ready to move to the desired destination or location. Before starting the truck, have another check on the location. Google Maps will help you. Remember the location and all the routes in between. Keep the cash if you have a toll plaza throughout the journey.</p>

              <h4>Unpacking your luggage</h4>
              <p>You have reached your destination and are welcome to your new house. It's time to unload your household goods. The labour will do that work for you. Inform them in advance if you live in an upper-floor apartment or need pulley or labour help to take your household goods. It will cost additional money. After reaching the house, you can unpack your goods and place them in the house.</p>
