            <!-- <========================= charges of packers and movers ===============================> -->
            <h2>Factors which affect your Shifting Cost</h2>
            <span class="underline"></span>
            <p>
                Estimating packers and movers charges can be complicated. The charges are always based on several aspects. All of these factors are examined by them in detail and finally, they determine the correct price they'll be charging to provide their service. The professionals who packers and movers do not charge any hidden or unneeded fees to their customers. They employ a fixed calculation technique and they base their charges on this cost. If they follow their principle of honesty clients and inform them of the charges they charge.
                <br>
                The main factors upon which their charges are based are as follows:
            </p>

            <h3>One of the main factors is distance</h3>
            <p>
                The primary factor that influences the cost is distance. The greater distance you need to cover, the more you will have to pay. Fuel consumption, as well as the costs of drivers, are all increased as you increase the number of kilometres you plan to cover. Because of the increased miles, drivers will have to spend longer and fuel usage will increase as well. Therefore, it will directly impact the price of moving.
            </p>

            <h3>Quantity and quality of packaging materials</h3>
            <p>
                Quantity and quality of packaging materials for gifting process especially in the wintertime, it's best to select a good-quality, waterproof packing materials even however it can raise the costs of packing and will directly impact and thus your costs for moving. In contrast, the use of inferior packing material will cost you less, however, the likelihood of damage to your property is very extremely high. The amount of merchandise used affects the packing materials required. With the increasing quantity of goods that are packed, the packing material needed is greater and, consequently, will increase the price.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of transport vehicles</h3>
            <p>
                Types of vehicles that are used to transport items from one location to another, vehicles are needed. The kind of vehicle you pick for moving will affect the prices of the packers and movers. If the truck's size is huge the company will charge you higher rates for your move. There are two kinds of trucks that can be used to transport your goods.
            </p>

            <h4>Shared truck</h4>
            <p>If you choose to lease a shared van, household belongings are shared by 2-3 people. Therefore, you will have to pay less for the transportation of your belongings to your new location.</p>

            <h4>A dedicated truck</h4>
            <p>On the other hand when you choose to use a truck that is dedicated and it is used to move your items only, and thus the entire cost of moving that you are required to pay. In this case, you will have to shell out more money and the cost of shifting is also higher.</p>

            <h3>The number of labourers needed</h3>
            <p>
                The amount of people needed to help you move is contingent on the number of goods that you bring to carry. If you are moving fewer items, you will require a few workers who will help you in moving the items. If you're moving a larger amount of items, it becomes difficult for one person to move the items and you will require more labour. The labour costs per hour will rise, and the total cost of moving is affected.
            </p>

            <h3>The amount of effort required to work</h3>
            <p>The amount of effort required to work physical effort influences the price of transportation. If the building is equipped with an elevator or lift facility, the physical effort required by workers is reduced and the cost may be lower. In the event of a lack of elevator facilities, workers are required to utilize a rope to move large and heavy objects. This increases the effort of the worker and consequently, the price will rise.</p>

            <h3>Additional facilities</h3>
            <p>If you require additional services from packing and moving firms in Agra like the assembly of your goods, placing them in their proper locations, and various other services they might charge you additional fees for these services and the price of moving from your old to your new home increases.</p>
