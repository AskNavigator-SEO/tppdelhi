            <h2>Factors which affect your Shifting Cost</h2>
            <span class="underline"></span>
            <p>
                The <b>packers and movers Charges in Bangalore</b> company vary because of the quality of service they provide. The difference in charges depends on many factors that are responsible for the change in the cost of shifting. Those factors are as follows-
            </p>

            <h3>Type of vehicle and goods have to move</h3>
            <p>
                If you have a high weight and large size vehicle and goods, then it directly impacts the charges. The bigger size of goods takes more space than the normal size, which means requires more trucks for moving that increases the cost. Also, for shipping valuable items and cars, the price of insurance is more in such a situation that also directly increases the cost.
            </p>

            <h3>Type of transportation services</h3>
            <p>
                For shifting purpose, the use of personal truck increase the cost more than that of hiring sharing trailer. Moreover, if you want a warehousing facility, it will add to more cost. In the same way, opting for an open car carrier causes less charge as your belongings will going to shift with others belongings, and your goods will expose to weather, air, and other things. However, people prefer to opt for the close carrier for their valuable goods that are more expensive.
            </p>

            <h3>Time factor while moving</h3>
            <p>
                Time factor also influences the cost of moving. <b>Packers and Movers in Bangalore</b> also have a low and high season. At the time of the holiday season, the companies are busy as everyone wants to shift their house at that time, and the companies are <b>free during monsoon and rainy</b>  summers seasons. Hence you may have to pay for your shifting more in the higher season and less in the low season.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shifting his typical work. It involves hard work and takes lots of

              city as Bangalore includes-
            </p>

            <h3>Self-shifting can take more time to shift</h3>
            <p>
              Shifting looks simple and easy job, but when someone starts doing
              it can understand the labor and stress involved. Shifting without
              knowledge results in wrong decisions and planning that cost
              additional time even a day for a person.
            </p>

            <p>
              Though shifting through a professional company requires charges
              but doing shifting your own will increase your cost. The traffic
              and long-distance will increase your cost of moving. In the whole
              transmit process your new items may also get damage that
              automatically increases your cost of moving.
            </p>

            <h3>Can be damage your goods</h3>
            <p>
              In Bangalore where distances are long requires lots of time to move
              from one place to another. Without knowledge and experience moving
              furniture, electronic appliances, delicate items is risky and you
              may face damages for these goods.
            </p>

            <h3>You can face personal injuries</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from the risk to your goods and property shifting the risk
              of self-injuries is also high when you decide to move your
              household material on your own. The chances of accidents and
              injuries are high.
            </p>

            <h3>Property can be damaged in self-shifting</h3>
            <p>

              present. The furniture, tiles, scratches on the wall may take
              place when you move your belongings without having sufficient
              knowledge.
